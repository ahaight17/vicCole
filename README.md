# Help Victor Cole Pay His Legal Fees

Victor Cole is a prisoner currently held at the High Desert State Prison. During sentencning, Victor was given multiple 5 year enhancements due to a now-changed law. If this law had not been in place during Victor's sentencing, he would already be released. Despite the law change, because Victor did not have an open case, he is ineligble for early release unless he makes an official petition for resentencing with the help of a lawyer. I am raising funds to help grant Victor early release and have written this Twitter bot to tweet at high-profile celebrities and other verified accounts asking for monetary help or publicity. 

If you would like to contact Victor yourself, he is always looking for new people to talk to. You can write him using [JPay](https://www.jpay.com). His inmate number is T99236.
